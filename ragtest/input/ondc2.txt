Abstract  Global digital commerce is reshaping 
the global business environment and has the 
potential to provide a more level playing field that is 
more welcoming to all types of businesses It has 
the potential to open up opportunities in the 
economy for new groups of players particularly for 
smaller businesses COVID19 has facilitated the 
growth of digital commerce throughout the world 
Although digital commerce in mobility and travel 
services declined it grew in the retail sector where 
its proportion of total retail sales has increased The 
increase in sales can be attributed to an increase in 
businesstoconsumer 
B2C 
sales 
This 
is 
especially evident in sales of household essentials 
medical supplies as well as food products online 
Additionally 
COVID19 
resulted 
in 
increased 
businesstobusiness B2B digital commerce The 
current version of ecommerce stifles innovation 
and also creates substantial barriers to access for 
novice players Industry analysts have found 
feasible solutions for managing the bottlenecks 
within Indias digital commerce ecosystem Taking 
ideas from the presently successful model solutions 
such as the Internet Message Access Protocol 
IMAP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP HTTP 
protocols for data communication and browsing 
and so on the Open Network for Digital Commerce 
ONDC 
has 
actually 
been 
developed 
to 
revolutionize digital commerce within India It is 
going to be an open network developed on open 
protocols based on opensource standards with set 
registries enabling widescale involvement by 
digital commerce ecosystem players within India 
via multiple gateways The Open Network for Digital 
Commerce ONDC project is intended to curb 
digital monopolies ONDC will offer a level playing

1INTRODUCTION  
As the world moves towards a more digital 
economy businesses are seeking innovative ways 
to connect with consumers A new network called 
ONDC is aiming to make this process easier by 
providing a platform for businesses of all sizes to 
connect with each other and conduct digital 
transactions In recent years the internet has 
transformed the way in which people communicate 
and shop With the rise of online shopping it is 
important for businesses to have a welldeveloped

digital infrastructure in order to keep up with the 
competition Online digital commerce is thriving 
and expanding rapidly 1 However there is still 
room for improvement when it comes to the way 
products are sold One solution is to create an open 
network that allows for more convenient and 
streamlined transactions The ONDC is a group 
effort to build an open ecosystem for digital 
commerce 2 It is also a network built on open 
protocols that will make it possible for any network
compatible application to be used to find and do 
local business in segments like grocery mobility 
food ordering and delivery hotel reservation as well 
as travel among other things The platform wants 
to bring in new customers stop digital monopolies 
help micro small and mediumsized businesses as 
well as small business owners get on online 
platforms and build a place where businesses of all 
sizes can safely and easily do business with each 
other and with thirdparty vendors 3 The ONDC 
also tries to encourage innovation by letting 
businesses share their best ideas This is a project of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Commerce 
and 
Industrys 
Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal 
Trade DPIIT The ONDC which is an ecommerce 
UPI wants to make digital or ecommerce more 
democratic by changing it from a platform centric 
model to the open network ON On ONDC traders 
would be able to save their data in order to build 
credit history and reach consumers The suggested 
governmentsupported platform aims to establish 
a level playing field for ecommerce Platforms 
would also be compliant with the Information 
Technology Act 2000 and specifically designed to 
comply with the emerging Personal Data Protection 
Bill In the system ONDC wants to make it possible 
for sellers and buyers to connect digitally and do 
business through an open network ON regardless 
of the platform or app they are using It would also 
allow merchants and customers to create a single 
network by breaking down silos This would 
encourage innovation and growth across all 
businesses from a retail goods to food to 
transportation 5 The new structure is designed to 
promote open networks drawn up on an open
sourced 
methodology 
that 
uses 
the 
open 
specifications as well as open network protocols not 
dependent on any particular platform This is 
expected to digitalize the whole value chain 
standardize 
the 
transactions 
promote 
the 
integration of suppliers obtain efficiencies for 
logistics and improve value for the consumer ONDC 
wish would take all appropriate methods to ensure 
confidentiality and the privacy of network data 6 
ONDC is not going to compel participants to share 
any transaction level data with ONDC It will work 
together with its attendees to publish anonymous 
aggregate metrics on network efficiency without 
sacrificing confidentiality and privacy This article 
describes major difficulties in the market that 
prompted the government to launch the ONDC 
initiative The ONDC promises to offer equal 
opportunities for small merchants It is correct to 
say that Digital Commerce DC will shift Indian e
commerce far from the current platformcentric 
model overlooked by market leaders With an open 
network when the ONDC is coming in there is a 
chance that even a tiny retailer will be able to be 
visible immediately across multiple platforms The 
ONDC is a nonprofit system that the government 
believes is going to be a game changer This is 
significant because the government wishes to 
disperse digital monopolies and duopolies of big 
technology companies Even without all the hype 
the ONDC initiative was expected to be as 
groundbreaking as UPI 
 
2AN OVERVIEW OF DIGITAL COMMERCE IN INDIA 
India has emerged as the fastest growing economy 
in the world and is projected to be one of the top 
three economies in the next 1015 years According 
to initial estimates gross domestic product at 
current prices stood at Rs 5123 lakh crore in the 1st 
quarter of FY2022 Indias digital commerce industry

 2022 PUIRJ       DOI 105281zenodo6799694                                                                 Page  94  
 
has evolved and gained significant momentum 
over the past years which has further accelerated 
under the constraints of COVID19 7 The digital 
transformation is in progress in terms of access to 
connectivity at an affordable cost The increase in 
penetration of smartphones and the increase in 
investments in the startup ecosystem are 
important factors that contribute to this India has 
the worlds third largest buyer base with 14 million 
retail buyers in 2020 second only to China and the 
United States This quantity is expected to rise 
rapidly with the addition of 37 million Generation Z 
consumers who grew up in an India with ubiquitous 
internet smartphones and digital and digital 
consumer platforms8 However the COVID19 
pandemic showed the shortcomings of Indias 
digital commerce ecosystem when most elements 
of the retail chain were found to be digitally absent 
and there was no complete supply chain Around 12 
crore kiranas account for eighty percent of the retail 
sector in India with 90 percent of them being 
unorganized or selforganized and most of them 
digitally excluded From September 2020 India is 
estimated to have 425 million micro small and 
mediumsized enterprises that thrive on innovative 
sales and marketing efforts but are not part of the 
digital revolution Even from the user side a small 
percentage of internet customers in India are online 
shoppers 79 The limitations are more evident in 
the share of trade in the overall segment of retail 
India The gross market value for retail digital 
commerce DC in the Indian market was 285 lakh 
crores in 2020 which is only 43 of total retail in 
India and well below retail penetration in countries 
like China Korea and the UK By 2026 digital 
commerce in the retail sector it is expected that 
India will reach Rs 15 lakh crores 
 
3AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM DIGITAL 
COMMERCE  
Humans have operated markets and exchanged 
value as buyers and sellers since the beginning of 
time The interactions between a seller or provider 
with something to offer and a buyer or consumer 
make it possible to create marketplaces of varying 
sizes 
and 
shapes 
The 
fragmented 
and 
decentralized market makes it harder and more 
complicated to carry out these transactions in the 
larger ecosystem of commerce across categories 
and locations In recent decades these markets 
have flourished digitally as a result of the internet 
which has enabled providers and consumers to 
move their interactions online Digital has caused a 
big change in how goods and services are delivered 
around the world It has also changed how people 
interact with markets which has upset the status 
quo 
in 
many 
industries 
such 
as 
retail 
transportation travel and hospitality 17 
In the digital world platforms allowing digital 
marketplaces for buyers as well as sellers evolving 
into large combined solutions that link the seller 
and the buyer with combined services such as 
logistics warehousing payment etc under one 
service provider The rapid expansion of these 
platforms has hampered the ability of new online 
sellers to compete unless they are affiliated with an 
established endtoend service provider Even 
though more platforms can and do come online the 
number of attendees is limited by the amount of 
money needed to set up such integrated solutions 
18 The buyers and sellers face the concentration 
risk of the platforms as the size of the platforms 
increases Even if the platform is run by the 
government consolidating the majority of digital 
commerce trades onto a single platform increases 
risk and creates a single point of failure With this 
faculty concentration the freedoms of exclusion and 
discretionary behavior begin to emerge So the 
platforms become operators on the market and 
small and mediumsized businesses lose the option 
and freedom to participate on their own terms 19 
This also takes the key issue of portability of trust 
The platforms enable the providers and consumers 
to create a credibility via the dealings allowed 
through their platforms which has considerable 
value However if a seller is eager to port its hard
Partners Universal International Research Journal PUIRJ 
                Volume 01 Issue 02  AprilJune 2022                wwwpuirjcom                               
 
 2022 PUIRJ       DOI 105281zenodo6799694                                                                 Page  95  
 
earned credibility or reputation trust to an 
additional platform or its very own applications 
independent of the initial platform it is not in a 
position to do so even though it is its own data as 
well as its credentials If thanks to misalignment of 
the incentive any of users in the platform like to stop 
using the present platform they are linked to they 
must forfeit all such values built up on a platform 
They cannot carry or move in the same way 
Therefore this pattern of value creation and the 
exchange converts platforms into the most 
important stores or keepers of value that locks the 
sellers into a particular system Figure 1 Its store of 
value concept has affected the large unimpeded 
freetoscale stream of value that a fair and 
effective market should possess 
 
Fig 1 The digital marketplace model of 
commerce 
 
Such a market structure can lead to numerous 
challenges In the event that sellers desire to be on 
various platforms they are needed by platforms to 
keep separate infrastructure as well as processes 
which increases their cost and also restricts their 
involvement Every platform will have their own 
terms and conditions which restrict the flexibility of 
vendors and with so much restricted flexibility the 
scope and diversity of involvement could be 
constrained Additionally the seller and  buyer must 
be on the same platform in order to find one 
another Such gaps result in restricted choice and 
search capabilities within the disjointed collection of 
platforms Purchasing from a close inventory online 
at the neighborhood Kirana store to get to know that 
someone is looking for something from the store 
remains a digital vacuum despite the apparently 
rapid progress of many digital platforms as well as 
the pervasiveness of phones and the internet The 
pandemic has only heightened such a challenge 
The Indian digital commerce ecosystem which is 
still in the middle of its evolution is not an exception 
to the preceding drawbacks Because of the 
immensity and diversity of its territory the problem 
is also compounded in the ecosystem of the 
country Several market participants are involved in 
efforts to deal with these issues including initiatives 
focused on digitization and onboarding of small and 
mediumsized 
companies 
These 
challenges 
however can be addressed only by using a 
coordinated strategy at a local scale There is a 
need to transform the digital commerce approach 
of scaling what works to a new approach of what 
works at scale 20 In light of the digital India 
initiative of the government the vibrant nature of 
the information technology IT sector as well as the 
urgency of the current pandemic it seems 
appropriate to establish and promote an alternate 
model of digital commerce through the digital 
inclusion of a wide range of crosssectional 
businesses The goal of this strategy is to make it 
possible for MSMEs and a wide range of buyers to 
use digital technology and do business online Even 
earlier India has demonstrated that it can transform 
hugescale projects with the ability to essentially 
disturb and democratize markets like UPI Unified 
Payment Interface and UIDAIUnique Identification 
Authority of IndiaAadhaar and more recently the 
GSTNGoods and Services Tax Network and the 
ABDMAyushman Bharat Digital Mission The Unified 
Payment Interface helped unify Indias business 
transactions so that all Indians should have the 
ability to make use of digital commerce to buy or 
sell goods or services 
4THE MAJOR OBJECTIVIES OF ONDC 
 
The major objectives are as follows

Fig 2 Objective of ONDC 
 
It will compare with Unified Payments Interface 
UPI ONDC which unites several digital commerce 
features seamless routing and online shopping 
features into a single unified application The ONDC 
is a platform that provides easy access to online 
shopping for consumers as well as a selling platform 
for small and mediumsized business owners in 
India 1415 
 
5THE AIM OF ONDC 
This 
ONDC 
platform 
aims 
to 
create 
new 
opportunities decrease digital monopolies as well 
as enable micro small and mediumsized 
businesses and small traders by making them 
online It is the creation of the MCIMinistry of 
Commerce and Industrys DPIIT Department for 
Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade 10 In a 
nation with a population of 135 billion ONDC intends 
to increase ecommerce penetration to twentyfive 
percent of all consumer purchases made during the 
next two years up from approximately eight percent 
currently 11 Within the next 5 years it is likely to 
register 900 million customers and 12 million 
vendors on a common network This will result in a 
gross merchandise value of USD 48 billion 
According to government figures Indias e
commerce business was estimated at over 55 
billion USD in gross merchandise valueGMV in 2021 
and is projected to expand to USD 350 billion before 
the end of the current decade According to a 
Reuters estimate Amazon and Walmarts Flipkart 
currently hold more than 60 percent of the market 
 
6THE ONDC STRUCTURE 
The ONDC uses freesoftware approach open 
network protocols and open specifications In ONDC 
customers as well as merchants can transact goods 
and services individually of any application or 
platform 14 Beckn will offer technology and 
specification layer that ONDC is going to design the 
network trust network policies network grievance 
management and network credibility systems 14 
ONDC plans to implement a more dynamic pricing 
model 
digitalized 
inventory 
monitoring 
and 
distribution cost optimization to assist lower the cost 
of conducting business for every person on the 
platform ONDC will operate on a hyperlocal 
searchengine model based upon the GPS proximity 
data as default setting 16 The customer can 
separately choose the seller and the logistics 
partner to finish the order 
 
7DESCRIPTION OF OPEN NETWORK  
The Open Network surpasses the present platform
centric model in which both buyer and seller should 
be part of the same platform or application to 
facilitate transactions Instead in an open network 
buyers and sellers can do business regardless of the 
platform or application they use to be digitally

visible or available 17 This allows for the free flow of 
information and value as shown in fig 3 
 
Fig 3 Description of Open Network 
 
An open network based on an open protocol will 
allow any networkenabled application to discover 
and engage in locationaware local commerce 
across industries As the IMAP Internet Message 
Access Protocol and SMTPSimple Mail Transfer 
Protocol are for email the Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol HTTP is for the World Wide Web and the 
Unified Payment Interface UPI is for payment 
systems the Open Network concept was created to 
change digital commerce in India The open network 
is 
prefaced 
on 
the 
fundamental 
ideas 
of 
decentralization openness and increased user 
utility By using these ideas the network will speed 
up the adoption of technology stacks and tools like 
artificial intelligence machine learning blockchain 
etc through innovation and experimentation at 
each node 
It is anticipated that the open network protocol will 
act as a force multiplier for various segments 
including 
businesses 
consumers 
application 
developers governments and other relevant 
participants by creating an interoperable and open 
playing field for these segments to operate and 
compete This open network will disaggregate the 
supply chain shifting the balance of power from the 
intermediaries to the end users merchants and 
providers of support services This will have the most 
effect on small businesses that want to use digital 
commerce to boost innovation and grow The open 
network concept is not limited to the retail industry 
its use cases and advantages can be extended to 
every digital commerce domain such as wholesale 
mobility food delivery logistics travel urban 
services etcany digital transaction between a 
buyer and seller for goods or services It has the 
ability to revolutionize both businesstoconsumer 
and businesstobusiness transactions 21 
8ABOUT THE BECKN PROTOCOL 
The Beckn Protocol an open and interoperable 
protocol for decentralized digital commerce is used 
to construct the ONDCs backend Beckn Gateways 
provide 
aggregated 
anonymized 
network
generated data2223 Interoperability is achieved 
by decoupling the packet transmission layer from 
the experience layer in order to standardize the core 
of commercial transactions such as discovery 
order booking payment delivery and fulfillment By 
taking a modular approach it can be tailored to the 
needs of both the customer and the provider 22 
The Beckn Foundation is now supporting the 
undertaking It facilitates the digital transaction 
layer the third layer of public digital infrastructure in 
an open digital ecosystem This aids in fostering 
market competition and regulating anticompetitive 
conduct The development happened because of 
the failure of US standard bodies to establish new 
standards leaving the issue to be resolved by large 
technology companies 24 The Beckn Protocol is a 
substitute for and is compatible with similar US
developed protocols used globally for computer 
transactions and the transmission of data The 
success of UPI led to the creation of more open
source ecosystems across the country in other 
fields 
9IMPLEMENTATION OF OPEN PROTOCOLS  
Despite the rapid expansion of Indian ecommerce 
the ONDC will be able to assist smaller companies 
which will benefit their business The ONDC will also 
help to democratize ecommerce in India so that

small popup stores and retailers do not suffer the 
same fate as they do in the West On the other hand 
the ONDC will enable small retailers to continue to 
exist in the larger ecommerce market because 
large ecommerce companies are continuously 
engaging in unusual practices and are under 
constant examination Through an open platform 
the ONDC gives small businesses and entrepreneurs 
the chance to connect directly with customers 
 
10 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING AN ALTERNATIVE 
STRATEGY  
Solutions designed to support the rapid expansion 
of digital marketplaces across sectors and regions 
must be fundamentally inclusive As depicted in 
Figure 4 the plan for such a populationscale 
initiative should be based on a solid foundation 
 
Fig 4 Guidelines for developing an alternative 
strategy 
 
11ONDC BUILDING BLOCKS 
An overview of technology components 
The technology components consist of the various 
network components like the registry gateway 
buyer and seller applications and the building 
blocks like adapter interfaces which can be used to 
generate these network components 25 
 
Adaptor Interfaces Adaptor interfaces are the open 
APIs created in accordance with the opensource 
interoperable specification of the Beckn protocol 
These interfaces documentation is available at 
wwwondcorg These APIs will allow sharing of 
information for the implementation of transactions 
allowing all network participants to communicate 
and integrate via interfaces certified by the ONDC 
Gateway 
Application 
that 
ensures 
search 
capabilities of all sellers in the network by 
broadcasting 
search 
requests 
from 
buyer 
applications to all seller applications by criteria 
such as location readiness and other customer 
preferences To launch the operations ONDC plans 
to provide a Gateway through its technology 
partners 
initially 
With 
increased 
volume 
of 
transactions it is anticipated that multiple gateway 
providers will emerge with independent service 
offerings in the network 
Open Registries Applications that keeps the 
corresponding list of participants that take part in 
ONDC the catalog of network policies etc 
Buyer and Seller Edge Applications These 
applications will allow endusers and sellers or 
service providers to conduct business on the ONDC 
network To encourage initial participation ONDC 
may roll out reference buyer and seller edge 
applications directly or via its technology partners 
Opensource reference applications will also be 
made available for service providers to adopt and 
build upon in order to join the ONDC network 26 
i ONDC Network at its core consists of network 
attendees who sign up ONDC as buyer side apps 
seller side apps or gateways to form the open 
network 
ii ONDC Network services on the right  displays 
the CNScommon network services that will allow 
network attendees to perform on the network and

12VISION OF ONDC TO MAKE ECOMMERCE MORE 
ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS 
Most likely an open network for digital commerce 
will make ecommerce more accessible and 
inclusive for consumers 22 Consumers can locate 
any seller product or service using an ONDC
compatible 
application 
or 
platform 
23 
Additionally the platform will assist consumers in 
matching demand with the nearest available 
supply and that this platform will allow consumers 
to 
choose 
their 
preferred 
local 
businesses 
standardize operations drive efficiencies as well as 
logistics and increase customer value 24 Small 
businesses 
can 
utilize 
ONDCcompatible 
applications as opposed to platformspecific 
policies This will facilitate their discoverability and 
business operations

India 
is 
becoming 
a 
worldwide 
economic 
powerhouse and a market leader in not only 
technology but also in developing governance and 
economic models that are different from both the

diplomacy India is a world leader in constructing 
digital infrastructures for public benefit The success 
and significant influence of initiatives such as the 
India Stack and JAM have demonstrated exactly 
how public digital infrastructure utilizing an open

to collaborate with Indian businesses could unlock 
huge potential activate service delivery on a large 
scale and affect the lives of a billion people E
commerce in India has drastically changed the way 
Indians do business and live their lives creating 
wealth jobs and a higher quality of life So far the 
impact of the COVID19 pandemic has thrown into 
sudden relief both the value and constraints of the 
existing model of ecommerce 12 For example e
commerce accounts for less than 4 of the entire 
retail commerce in India while Kiranas which are 
hyperlocal neighbourhood provision stores make up 
80 of the retail sector and have been largely 
barred from digital commerce 13 Despite the fact 
that the increase in access to the internet and 
smartphone 
access 
is 
Furthering 
digital 
transformation in the nation what India requires is 
to shift towards an allencompassing digital 
commerce that opens up innovation democratizes 
value 
chains 
improves 
efficiency 
and 
responsiveness and enables both merchants as 
well as consumers 
 
14TECHNOLOGICAL FACILITATION OF TRADE 
An ONDC could be a significant development for the 
ecommerce industry in India because it will allow 
businesses to compete directly without the need for 
intermediaries This could be a significant boon for 
small businesses in India as they will no longer be 
reliant on traditional ecommerce platforms that 
primarily benefit large businesses It will provide 
technological solutions to facilitate trade and its 
benefits include Access to the expansion of digital

commerce via sellerand buyerside applications 
will provide new opportunities for startups to 
promote innovation in various network segments It 
will be possible to achieve a shorter time to market 
and time to scale Focus on specialized features that 
will enable other partners to focus on other aspects 
15THE ECOMMERCE REVOLUTION WITH ONDC IN 
INDIA 
To facilitate small and mediumsized businesses 
access to online platforms the ONDC intends to 
create new opportunities and eliminate digital 
monopolies This could be a gamechanger for the 
ecommerce industry particularly in India It will 
compete with major players and make it easier for 
businesses to purchase sell and exchange goods 
and services Small and mediumsized businesses 
will also be able to bypass the conventional e
commerce platforms that favor larger corporations 
This government bank platform will level the playing 
field for ecommerce titans such as Flipkart and 
Amazon as well as small offline merchants the 
backbone of the Indian retail industry Small 
business owners have always been dissatisfied with 
the business practices of larger corporations such 
as Amazon and Flipkart A revolution will occur if the 
governments plan is successful Millions of small 
businesses will be able to go online 
16ONDC 
AND 
THE 
CURBING 
OF 
DIGITAL 
MONOPOLIES  
It is anticipated that the Indian ecommerce market 
will grow to be a 200 billion industry  However the 
government must confront numerous challenges 
and develop strategies to address them Small to 
mediumsized players have a bright future More 
people will spend money on products that reflect 
their culture and identity resulting in more 
alterations to their habits and way of life As the 
Indian economy grows it is inevitable that more of 
these goods will be consumed Consequently the 
retail ecommerce industry will expand as a result 
This will bring an end to digital monopolies in the e
commerce industry 
17ONDC IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY  
Taking into account the variety of use cases and 
ecosystem participants implementing ONDC on a 
large scale to make it a public utility is a longterm 
endeavor Given the transformational change that 
ONDC will bring to how the digital commerce 
industry works today it will face difficulties in 
establishing trust among small and large digital 
commerce 
companies 
managing 
user 
expectations and addressing customer and seller 
fraud issues Therefore the initial phase of the ONDC 
must be implemented rapidly in order to gain 
acceptance and identify practical considerations 
for implementing it on a larger scale The strategy 
for executing the ONDC has been designed to 
emphasize three major aspects technology 
business and institutionbuilding 
18 THE CHALLENGES OF ONDC 
What is the likelihood of large ecommerce 
companies joining ONDC Large ecommerce 
companies have protested because they have 
already made substantial investments in RD and 
the deployment of their own processes and 
technologies Through aggressive discounts and the 
promotion of preferred sellers Amazon and Flipkart 
have invested a combined total of US 24 billion to 
capture 80 of the Indian ecommerce market 
Indian retail giants Tata as well as Reliance have 
also made retail platforms shopping applications 
and super applications 27 
Existing Data Privacy Concerns If the ONDC 
functions as advertised it will manage vast 
quantities 
of 
highly 
sensitive 
personal 
and 
commercial data making data security an absolute 
necessity The sections on data privacy are vague 
and require immediate clarification especially in 
light of the pending data protection legislation The 
strategy document states that transaction data will 
only reside within the applications of the buyer and 
seller and will not be visible to the ONDC The ONDC 
will not store or view transaction information The 
data 
policies 
will 
be 
consentbased 
and 
constrained by purpose limitation The ONDC will

ensure the data security of transactions and protect 
the personally identifiable information of users and 
tradecritical seller data from unauthorized access 
by third parties The manner in which the ONDC 
ensures this level of security is crucial to the 
networks credibility and consequently the adoption 
of this system 27 
 
19 CONCLUSIONS 
ONDC aims to be a communityled initiative and to 
democratize the Indian ecommerce market by 
creating a level playing field for all businesses It is 
being launched in response to concerns stated by 
market bodies merchants and sellers about the 
growing dominance of large corporations in Indias 
digital commerce sector An ONDC is a government 
initiative that promotes open networks for the 
exchange of all digital goods and services Currently 
a consumer who is only connected to one portal 
can only make purchases on that site On this 
network users are able to buy products and services 
from any company without having to navigate to 
another 
ecommerce 
platform 
With 
the 
introduction of ONDC it is hoped that all online 
businesses will have equal exposure and access to 
development opportunities There are significant 
difficulties to the broader adoption and penetration 
of digital commerce that have not been addressed 
in the article Platform to Network focuses on 
rethinking digital commerce for the next decade 
and introducing a new way of thinking about digital 
commerce that promises to be more inclusive and 
drive wider adoption There are few growing pains 
that should be anticipated and planned for in the 
process of expanding the network ONDC may not 
solve all the issues that currently function as 
obstacles to the adoption and penetration of digital 
commerce on both the buyer and seller sides but it 
goes a long way toward addressing some of the 
segments most pressing issues ONDC is a market
creating opportunity that will not only contribute to 
the expansion of the digital commerce market but 
will also have a substantial impact on the economy 
including employment the creation of livelihoods 
and supply chain efficiencies among other things 
The main and most crucial goal of this platform is to 
defend government rules and regulations while also 
keeping an eye on all aspects of ecommerce 
company growth
