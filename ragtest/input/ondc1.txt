Outlining ONDCS future plans Agrawal said Going forward the target of the ONDC is to onboard 3cr 
sellers  1cr retail merchants online In the next step we want to go to 100 cities in 6 months 
He also said that more local language support will be added to the app in the near future to expand the no of 
buyers  sellers Apart from sellers  buyers logistics players  payment gateways will be part of ONDC 
which has Infosys cofounder Nandan Nilekani former Mc Kinsey India head Adil Zainulbhaia National 
Health Authority CEO Rs Sharma among others as key advisers 
Currently there are more than 4000 small and big ecommerce companies in India 500 logistics companies 
to deliver products and more than 20000 entities including travel and hotels that provide services through e
market The Indian emarket is expected to grow to USD 200 billion by 2026 
 
This open network will not be owned or controlled by a single application or platform and the idea behind it 
is to bring buyers suppliers payment and logistics providers together through opensource specifications and 
protocols ONDC will be created by unbundling breaking down of a complex system into granular activities 
the current system

 DIFFICULTY WHICH COULD BE FACED 
 Education of ecommerce  As most of the traders are from small scale industry which means they 
could have very little or no information about emarket Which will 
 make it difficult for them to access 
 Responsible  If the product is late or the product got damaged due to some reason who will be 
responsible for it Is it the buyer or the logistic Who will give the refund 
 GST returns  As the buyer will be in profit and a lot of sales will be taking place which would make 
buyer responsible to collect GST from buyers which may create a lot of confusion among the buyer 
INTERPRENTATION  
India is the 3rd largest retail market It was highest in 2018 Whereas ecommerce in India is still less 
compared to others But growth rate is still higher compared to other country in the year 2019 it was 
248  
 
 
Even though the amount is less but the growth rate is higher compared to others 
For sellers 
For buyers 
For tech platforms

Access to more sellers

timetoscale

More options for value chain 
services

CONCLUSION  
As the time is passing people are more interested surfing online instead of going out and looking for the 
product 
  
Which means people look for easy way to get things done If ONDC is going as per it is planned it would be 
a big revolution in the country just like the UPI system But if it doesnt work as it is planned there would a 
drastic loss to the government of over 22 million
